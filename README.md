# 🧠 C-Explorations: Semester 1 Logic Lab

This repository is a curated collection of my C programs written during **Semester 1 of B.Tech CSE**. It reflects my hands-on practice with core programming concepts — from basic loops to number logic. All programs are written in a single-folder format and demonstrate early-stage logic building.

## 📁 Program List

All files are `.c` source files. Here's a summary of what you'll find:

```
• armstrong.c        → Check if a number is an Armstrong number  
• factorial.c        → Calculate factorial of a number  
• reverse.c          → Reverse digits of a number  
• prime.c            → Check whether a number is prime  
• fibonacci.c        → Generate a Fibonacci sequence  
• palindrome.c       → Check if a number is a palindrome  
• sum_digits.c       → Calculate the sum of digits  
• strong_number.c    → Identify strong numbers  
• perfect_number.c   → Check for perfect numbers  
• even_odd.c         → Check whether a number is even or odd  
... and more!
```

## 🎯 Purpose

- Strengthen **problem-solving skills**  
- Prepare for **viva and lab exams**  
- Practice **fundamentals of C** (loops, conditions, math logic)  
- Keep a clean and consistent archive of my learning

## 🛠 How to Run These Programs

All files are written in standard ANSI C and can be compiled using GCC:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
```

_Example:_

```bash
gcc armstrong.c -o armstrong
./armstrong
```

You can also run them in any C IDE like Code::Blocks, Turbo C++, or VS Code with the C/C++ extension.
